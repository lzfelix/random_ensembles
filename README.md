# Random Ensembles

To reproduce a smaller version of the code and get an overall idea, please run
`hyperparam_learning.ipynb` and then `ensemble_learning.ipynb'.


# Scripts

The following scripts are available to run the experiments. Running
either of them with the `-h` flag shows their running options. 

   - `hyper_learner.py` Learns model hyperparameters;
   - `ensemble_learner.py` Learns weighted ensembles using some metaheuristic;
   - `runner.py` Runs the baseline models with their default hyperparameters
